v0.5.6 Custom Resources & Auth Fixes

NEW: ZedDisplay now uses dedicated SignalK resource types for crew messaging, profiles, files, channels, and alarms. Other apps won't see your ZedDisplay data.

FIXED: Auth tokens now stored per connection ID, not server URL. Multiple connections to same server work correctly.

FIXED: Deleting a connection removes its auth token.
