# Google Play Store Internal Testing Release Guide

## Current Status
- **App Name:** SignalK ZedDisplay
- **Package:** com.zennora.zed_display
- **Version:** 0.1.0+2 (Version Name: 0.1.0, Version Code: 2)

---

## Step 1: Create Upload Keystore

Run this command in your terminal to create a signing key:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000 \
  -alias upload
```

You'll be prompted for:
- **Keystore password** (choose a strong password and save it securely!)
- **Key password** (can be same as keystore password)
- **Name and organization details** (fill in your details)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Save your keystore and passwords securely! If you lose them, you can never update your app on Play Store.

---

## Step 2: Configure Key Properties

Edit the file `android/key.properties` with your actual values:

```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=/Users/mauricetamman/upload-keystore.jks
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` with the password you chose
- `YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD` with the key password
- Update the path to your keystore if you saved it elsewhere

---

## Step 3: Build Release Bundle

Clean and build the release AAB (Android App Bundle):

```bash
# Clean previous builds
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build the release AAB
flutter build appbundle --release
```

The AAB will be created at:
```
build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

---

## Step 4: Test the Release Build (Optional but Recommended)

You can test with an APK first:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
flutter install --release -d <device-id>
```

## Security Checklist

‚úÖ Keystore saved in secure location (NOT in project directory)
‚úÖ `key.properties` added to `.gitignore`
‚úÖ Keystore passwords stored securely (password manager)
‚úÖ Release builds configured and tested
‚úÖ ProGuard rules configured for code optimization

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Signing key not found"
- Make sure `key.properties` has correct paths
- Check that keystore file exists at specified location

### "Upload failed - version code already exists"
- Increment the version code in `pubspec.yaml`

### "APK/AAB too large"
- Current optimizations are enabled (minify, shrink resources)
- Check that you're not including unnecessary assets

---
